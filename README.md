7. Hopes and Fears:
    I've just arrived in Australia a week ago. I'm not very familiar with the place and how things work yet. Luckily, I've done some online research about university, Sydney, and the place to stay prior coming here. Getting an offer to stay at IH UNSW during my study is such a good deal to me as neccessary facilities are all available, every meal is catered and I can meet bunch of students from around the world! This make my life a lot easier. However, important information and activities are usually announced on Whatapps and Facebook group (sometimes I know from friends updated me when we're having dinner) which make it hard to scroll up when there're too many chats going on. I hope there's a combined platform or mobile app that I can access and stay updated on the events. It would be great if I can cross check other residents' name as well because I'm bad at rembering people's name and it's so awkward when I have to ask them multiple times.
    

# Story-boarding + App funtionality
- filter only current students
- zoom in to enlarge pic
# App extensibility
- Current limitation: Due to Facebook's privacy policy, we're not to be able to import picture from Instagram through hashtag, so I integrated a direct image upload using Microsoft Flow to trigger the automation from Power Apps into Sharepoint when a user upload an image into the app through Home page. However, after multiple attempt from different tutorials/methods, I can't make it work at the moment for some reasons, but this is the idea.
- The app can be scaled to cover accommodation office for communication such as parcel receive, fire drill, check-in/out, etc. This app can also implement on other student accommodations/communities as well.
